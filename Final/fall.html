                    <p>Gobbler's are the first annoyance you will probably encounter in the Fall while collecting berries for food. They appear out of berry bushes when you pick berries and they eat all the other surrounding berries. These pesky turkey's are a pain to kill because they're pretty fast.
                    	One tip to killing them is to drop some food on the ground. The gobbler will go for the food without running away! They don't attack back and once they're dead, they drop two turkey legs which is great for food!</p>

                    	more difficult to leave your base without being prepared. Make sure to reveal as much of the map as you can while still prioritizing base building and crop farming. Revealing the map and knowing where to find things
                    	is very useful during the later seasons when days get shorter and nights get longer! Every map is different, so keep exploring! Make sure to find as many different turfs as you can and as many touch stones as you can!</p>

                    <p>Base building is one of the most important parts of the game. Since Fall is the most peaceful and easiest season to survive, its best to start base building during this season.
                    A good place to build your base, from experience, is either by a herd of Beefalo (pictured left) in the Savannah turf, or by the Pig King (pictured right) in Decidious turf. 
                    The reason for this is for safety. During the Fall you will get attacked by Hounds and since you are just starting the game, you won't have many resources to survive or kill of the
                    Hounds. Running into the herd of Beefalo until a Beefalo get's bitten will cause the Beefalo to attack the Hounds and vice versa. This will grant you safety. The same goes for the Pig King.
                    If a pig from the pig village is attacked by a Hound, they will attack. This is the best way to survive the first hound attack. Along with safety, these two areas will grant you easy and close
                    access to poop or meat when needed. Once you find an area, you want to start digging up grass tufts, twigs and berry bushes and planting them by your base. These will help you survive throughout
                    the entire year and this is a very important step when base building that you cannot skip!</p>
