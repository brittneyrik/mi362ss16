                    <p>Obviously in the spring, its going to rain! So <b>make sure you have a lightning rod</b>. Without a lightning rod, you risk the chance of something in your base
                    	being struck by lightning, causing your entire base to catch on fire. RIP BASE. Have a couple of them scattered throughout your base. Its best when building them
                    	to know that the lightning rod will cover all objects up to two screens away. With regular rain, also comes frog rain! This is the most annoying thing about spring
                    	because frogs are seriously a pain in the butt! The best way I have found to deal with this is to litter your base with traps. If the frogs don't jump into them by
                    	themsevles, you can bait them into it by getting aggro and then running through the trap. Once they are trapped, they automatically turn to frog legs! Another way to
                    	deal with this is using the Beefalo. They are most likely in heat during this season, so they will kill the frogs if they get too close!

                	<div class="col-md-6">
                    <p align="left">Rain makes your character wet. When wetness reaches 100, you start to lose sanity. Also keep in mind that its not necessarily "hot" during the first days of spring,
                    	so always keep a thermal stone with you. There are a couple of ways to keep your sanity up. Use an eyebrella. In the winter you killed the Deerclops and retrieved the eye. The
                    	eyebrella is the ultimate protection against rain because its a hat, so you can wear it while equipping your essential items in your hand, opposed to crafting an umbrella and
                    	using it in your hand. Of course, if you are playing with other people, only one person can get an eyebrella, so others will need to make an umbrella to keep their wetness down. A
                    	good way to stay sane without an eyebrella is using an umbrella + Tam o' Shanter to keep sanity up and wetness down. If this doesn't help, build a tent, and sleep during the night 
                    	to regain sanity. Remember that your hunger decreases drastically during sleep, so eat before and after you sleep. </p>

                    <p>During the spring all bee's become hostile and turn into killer bees. Steer clear of bees during the spring, they hurt!
                    	Thankfully during the spring your crops will start to grow again. So you don't have to live off the land anymore. You can thrive
                    	and rebuild anything that was ruined in the winter. Expanding your base during this season is a good idea as well. </p>

                	<div class="col-md-6">
                    <p align="left">The Goose is the spring boss of the world. It's not as annoying as Deerclops but you need to kill this boss and its babies (mossling) in
                    	order to survive summer. They spawn anywhere there is a destroyed nest. These can appear anywhere in the map, not necessarily by the player. They don't 
                    	aggro the player unless the player tries to kill the babies, so if you don't want to mess with this boss, don't mess with the babies! The most dangerous
                    	part of this boss is the babies. Once you kill the Goose (pictured right) the babies go into a frenzy and turn into tornadoes. All of the babies aggro the
                    	player and they're fast! The best way to fight them is to not run in a straight line, and after they're done spinning, they get dizzy and you can attack them 
                    	at that point. They will drop feathers that can be used in the summer to cool yourself down. </p>
