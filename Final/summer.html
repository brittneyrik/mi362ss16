                    <p>Summer is the hardest season in my opinion because what you can do is very limited. During summer the heat gets really intese! Make sure you use a thermal stone
                    	to keep yourself cool. Put it in the fridge or by an endothermic firepit, and it will turn blue indicating that its cold. Once you start seeing small embers floating
                    	in the air, that means its hot enough to start forest fires. When this day comes, you do not want to walk near anything important! Fires will start on anything by 
                    	the player. Bring the down feathers you got from the mosslings in the spring, if something catches on fire, use the feather to put it out and immediately leave the area.
                    	If a fire has started you can run away so that the fire is offscreen, and it will put itself out instead of burning <i>everything</i> down. This is good if you accidently
                    	start a forest fire, but don't care about a couple of trees burning down. Summer is by far the most boring season because you won't be able to do much without risk of
                    	burning something down.

                    <p align="left">To combat the heat, you need two things. An endothermic firepit is the opposite of a regular firepit. It cools things down around it. This is essential for summer
                    	because when you're in base at night time, you'll want to stand around this firepit instead of a really hot one. The endothermic firepit doesn't emit as much light as the regular
                    	firepit, so I usually build them next to each other, and light both of them during the summer. If you're traveling and are away from your base, you'll want to have nitre on you at
                    	all times during summer so you can build small endothermic fires. You'll probably be in your base often so the chances of your base catching on fire are <b>high</b>. In order to be able
                    	to live in your base during summer, you'll want to build an Ice Flingomatic. You need ice the ice that I told you to save in order to build this. At this time, all the glaciers have 
                    	already melted, so you're out of luck if you don't have any left over. The Ice Flingomatic will throw snowballs at any staring fire that is in its radius (including the firepit!) so 
                    	make sure you place it near your most important things!</p>

                   <div class="col-md-9">
                    <p>I would recommend building a very small summer base during this time. Ice Flingomatics require gears in order to be crafted, and gears are a very
                    	limited resource in this game. The best place to build a summer base would be in the desert biome. The reason for this is because during summer, the
                    	cactus flower blooms, and you can live off of that during your time there. You can limit yourself to just one Ice Flingomatic, to save gears and bring
                    	a few tufts and crops with you if you're afraid there won't be enough cactus to survive. There are lots of tumble weeds in the desert, so you will have
                    	plenty of grass and twigs to fuel the fire. With too many Ice Flingomatics in your base, you will hear lots of noise and your FPS will suffer because
                    	it is constantly moving and the pixels need to be loaded. Also during this time, regular hounds turn to fire hounds. Once they die, they catch fire, so be
                    	careful when dealing with fire hounds. Stay away from anything important! </p>
